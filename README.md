# Organic Compound Visualizer Windows Apps

In this repository I used the library in my repository [OrganicCompoundVisualizerlibraries](https://github.com/thieupepijn/OrganicCompoundVisualizerLibraries)
to create a .NET/C# Console app and a .NET/C# WPF app which convert the IUPAC name of an organic compound/molecule into a two-dimensional image of this
compound/molecule.
